# P-Value-Google-VS-Apple

I am a data scientist and programmer integrating an app store into a custom operating system I am designing. I can choose to integrate the Apple Store or Google Play, but not both. I want to use the platform that sells the best quality apps. I decide to use the app ratings as a quality metric and gather some data about rating from the two stores. 

In this case study, I analyzed whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on these two platforms that would justify choosing one over the other.

For this peurpose, I used permutaion test and P-value calculation after data cleaning and integrating. The results showed that platform does impact on ratings. Specifically, we should advise our client to integrate only Google Play into their operating system interface.
